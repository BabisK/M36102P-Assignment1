\begin{enumerate}

  \item Assume that $A$ and $B$ are events of the sample space $S$ for which we
  know: $2P(A)-P(A')=3/5$, $P(B|A)=5/8$, $P(A|B)=4/9$. Calculate the following
  probabilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $P(A)$
        \begin{align}
          2P(A)-P(A')=3/5& \Leftrightarrow 2P(A)-(1-P(A))=3/5 \nonumber\\
          & \Leftrightarrow 2P(A)-1+P(A)=3/5 \nonumber\\
          & \Leftrightarrow 3P(A)=8/5 \nonumber\\
          & \Leftrightarrow P(A)=8/15
        \end{align}
      \item $P(A\cap B)$
        \begin{align}
          P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}& \Leftrightarrow P(A\cap
          B)=P(B|A)P(A) \nonumber \\
          & \Leftrightarrow P(A\cap B)=5/8\times8/15=1/3
        \end{align}
      \item $P(B)$
        \begin{align}
          P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}& \Leftrightarrow P(B)=\frac{P(A\cap
          B)}{P(A|B)}=\frac{1/3}{4/9}=9/12=3/4
        \end{align}
      \item $P(A\cup B)$
        \begin{align}
          P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)=8/15+3/4-1/3=171/180
        \end{align}
      \item Are the events $A$ and $B$ independent? \\
      Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$. For our
      problem:
      $$P(A)P(B)=8/15\times3/4=2/5\neq P(A\cap B)$$
      Thus the events $A$ and $B$ are not independent.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Suppose that a sample space $S$ has $n$ elements. Prove that the number
  of subsets that can be formed from the elements of $S$ is $2^n$. \\
  Each element of the sample space can either belong to a certain subset or not.
  Thus there are two ways to create each subset either by including each element
  or not. Thus there are $2^n$ subsets.
  \item Two players, A and B, alternatively and independently flip a coin and
  the first player to obtain a head wins. Assume player A flips first.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If the coin is fair, what is the probability that player A wins?\\
      The coin is fair means that $P(\text{heads})=P(\text{tails})=1/2$. Player
      A wins if he flips heads. As each flip is an indipendent event, this
      happens with probability $P(\text{heads})=1/2$ on the first flip, with
      probability $P(\text{tails,tails,head})=1/8$ on the third flip and with
      probability $P(\text{tails,tails,tails,tails,head})=1/32$. In general the
      probability that player A wins in his $n^{th}$ attemp is:
      $$P(A\text{ wins in } n^{th} \text{
      attempt})=\frac{1}{2\times2^{2(n-1)}}$$
      Thus the probability that a wins is:
      $$P(A \text{
      wins})=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2\times2^{2(i-1)}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2\times2^{2i}}$$
      \item More generally assume that $P(\text{head})=p$ (not necessarily
      $1/2$). What is the probability that player A wins?\\
      If $P(\text{heads})=p$ then $P(\text{tails})=1-p$. Based on the
      calculations above:
      $$P(A \text{ wins})=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{p\times(1-p)^{2i}}$$
      \item Show that $\forall p$ such that $0<p<1$, we have that $P(A\text{
      wins})>1/2$.\\
      $$P(B \text{ wins})=1-P(A \text{ wins})$$
      Also as player flips the coin second, he wins on his first attempt if
      player a flips a tails and then player B flips a heads. In general his
      probability to win is:
      $$P(B \text{ wins})=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{p\times(1-p)^{2i+1}}$$
      Obviously $P(A)>P(B)$ thus:
      $$P(A)>P(B) \Leftrightarrow P(A)>1-P(A) \Leftrightarrow P(A)>1/2$$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item A telegraph signals ``dot'' and ``dash'' sent in the proportion $3 : 4$,
  where erratic transmission cause a dot to become dash with probability $1/4$
  and a dash to become a dot with probability $1/3$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item If a dash is received, what is the probability that a dash has been
      sent?\\
      From the data we have we can get these information:
      $$P(\text{dot sent})=3/7$$
      $$P(\text{dash sent})=4/7$$
      $$P(\text{dash received}|\text{dot sent})=1/4$$
      $$P(\text{dot received}|\text{dot sent})=3/4$$
      $$P(\text{dot received}|\text{dash sent})=1/3$$
      $$P(\text{dash received}|\text{dash sent})=2/3$$
      The probability we are looking for is $P(\text{dash sent}|\text{dash
      received})$. From Bayes' rule:
      $$P(\text{dash sent}|\text{dash received})=P(\text{dash
      received}|\text{dash sent})\times\frac{P(\text{dash
      sent})}{P(\text{dash received})}$$
      Also:
      \begin{align}
      P(\text{dash received})&=P(\text{dash received}\cap\text{dash
      sent})+P(\text{dash received}\cap\text{dot sent})\nonumber\\
      &=P(\text{dash received}|\text{dash sent})P(\text{dash sent})+\nonumber\\
      &\quad+P(\text{dash received}|\text{dot sent})P(\text{dot sent})\nonumber\\
      &=2/3\times4/7+1/4\times3/7\nonumber\\
      &=8/21+3/28\nonumber\\
      &=41/84
      \end{align}
      Thus:
      $$P(\text{dash sent}|\text{dash
      received})=2/3\times\frac{4/7}{41/84}=\frac{672}{861}=\frac{32}{41}$$
      \item Assuming independence between signals, if the message dot-dot was
      received, what is the probability distribution of the four possible
      messages that could have been sent?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with pdf $f(x)$ and cdf $F(x)$.
  For a fixed number $x_0$ (such that $F(x_0)<1$), define the function:
    \begin{align} g(x)=
      \begin{cases}
        \frac{f(x)}{1-F(x_0)} \quad &x\geq x_0 \\
        0 \quad &x<x_0
      \end{cases}
    \end{align}
  Prove that $g(x)$ is a pdf (also known as hazard function).
  \item A truncated discrete distribution is one in which a particular class
  cannot be observed and is eliminated from the sample space. In particular, if
  $X$ has range $0,1,2,\ldots$ and the $0$ class cannot be observed (as is
  usually the case), the $0$-truncated random variable $X_T$ has pmf:
  $$P(X_T=x)=\frac{P(X=x)}{P(X>0)}, \quad x=1,2,\ldots$$
  Find the pmf, mean and variance of the $0$-truncated $Poisson(\lambda)$ random
  variable.
\end{enumerate}
